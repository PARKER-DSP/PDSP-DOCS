# TimeBase v1 Canonical Standard

This document standardizes the **canonical time representation** used for musical/MIDI processing.

Goal: the same preset/share-link produces the same result in:
- web demo
- core engine tests
- DAW/plugin shells (JUCE)

Timing determinism is the foundation for groove tools (quantize/swing), arps, generators, and MIDI-to-DSP synchronization.

---

## 1) Canonical time unit: `ticks` (PPQ 960)

### Normative rule

All musical events in core are time-stamped in:

- `ticks`: signed 64-bit integer
- **PPQ** (pulses per quarter note) = **960**

Tick zero definition:
- `ticks = 0` corresponds to the project transport origin (bar 1 beat 1) in the active tempo map.

Why PPQ 960:
- high resolution for swing/groove/humanize without floating drift
- common “high PPQ” that still stays integer-friendly and portable

### Invariants

- `ticks` MUST be integer.
- Conversions from floating time MUST use explicit rounding rules (below).
- Sorting is always by increasing `ticks` (then tie-breakers defined in event specs).

---

## 2) Tempo map and conversion responsibilities

TimeBase v1 separates:
- **canonical musical time**: ticks (portable)
- **render time**: sample frames (host-dependent)

Adapters (web transport, DAW host, offline renderer) are responsible for:
- providing a tempo map
- mapping `ticks ↔ seconds ↔ sampleFrames` deterministically

Core is responsible for:
- tick arithmetic (quantize, delay, swing)
- deterministic transformations of event times

---

## 3) Rounding rules (normative)

- `ticks = roundNearestTiesDown(beats * 960)`


Quantization rounding policy (choose one and be consistent):
- **Nearest** with ties to **down** (recommended):
  - if exactly halfway between grid points, choose the earlier tick

Definition (normative): **roundNearestTiesDown(x)** chooses the nearest integer to `x`; if `x` is exactly halfway, it chooses `floor(x)`.

This prevents jitter and makes quantize stable under repeated application.

---

## 4) Reference types

### TypeScript

```ts
export type Ticks = bigint; // use bigint to avoid precision loss in JS

export type TimeStamp = {
  ticks: Ticks;
};

// canonical constant
export const PPQ: bigint = 960n;
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

using Ticks = std::int64_t;

struct TimeStamp {
  Ticks ticks;
};

static constexpr Ticks PPQ = 960;
```

---

## 5) Reference helpers (TypeScript)

```ts
export const PPQ = 960n;

/**
 * Convert beats -> ticks using "nearest, ties down (floor)" rounding.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: beats is a floating point number; use ticks as the canonical time in core logic.
 */
export function beatsToTicks(beats: number): bigint {
  if (!Number.isFinite(beats)) throw new Error("beats must be a finite number");

  const x = beats * Number(PPQ);
  const q = Math.floor(x);        // always <= x
  const r = x - q;                // in [0, 1)
  const t = r > 0.5 ? q + 1 : q;  // ties (r === 0.5) go down -> q
  return BigInt(t);
}

export function ticksToBeats(ticks: bigint): number {
  return Number(ticks) / Number(PPQ);
}

/**
 * Quantize ticks to a grid in ticks.
 * Tie-break: choose earlier grid point on exact halves.
 */
function divModFloor(a: bigint, b: bigint): { q: bigint; r: bigint } {
  // Mathematical floor division/mod, with r in [0, b)
  let q = a / b;
  let r = a % b;
  if (r < 0n) {
    q -= 1n;
    r += b;
  }
  return { q, r };
}

/**
 * Quantize ticks to a grid in ticks.
 * Tie-break: choose earlier grid point on exact halves.
 */
export function quantizeTicks(t: bigint, grid: bigint): bigint {
  if (grid <= 0n) throw new Error("grid must be > 0");
  const { q, r } = divModFloor(t, grid);
  const half = grid / 2n;
  if (r > half) return (q + 1n) * grid;
  return q * grid;
}
```

---

## 6) Schema (portable)

```json
{
  "$id": "parker://schema/timeStamp/v1",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["ticks"],
  "properties": {
    "ticks": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Signed integer ticks (PPQ=960) encoded as a decimal string for JSON portability."
    }
  }
}
```

Note: JSON cannot represent 64-bit integers safely across all runtimes; using a decimal string avoids precision drift.

---

## 7) Test vectors

- 1 quarter note = 960 ticks
- 1 bar of 4/4 = 4 * 960 = 3840 ticks

- grid = 120 ticks (1/32 note at PPQ 960)
- `t = 179` ticks → nearest is `120` ticks
- `t = 181` ticks → nearest is `240` ticks
- `t = 180` ticks (exact half) → tie-break to earlier: `120` ticks

If any layer produces different results for these conversions/quantize rules, it is not following TimeBase v1.
